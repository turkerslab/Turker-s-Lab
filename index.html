        <h2>About Professor Turker's Research</h2>
        <p>Professor Turker's research largely concerns model-based testing. This research is important because it allows the development of automated techniques (and tools) that generate efficient, systematic test suites quickly based on formal models that encapsulate the behaviour of the underlying software.</p>

        <p>Prof. Turker has recently become interested in testing cyber-physical and autonomous systems equipped with self-learning control algorithms. He invented the Q-Graph Learning framework.</p>

        <h2>Accelerating Finite State Machine-Based Testing using Convolutional Neural Networks</h2>
        <p>Professor Turker and his PhD student Mr Walker are developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is used to accelerate Finite Sate Machine-Based Testing. 
            In this work, the CNN is used to identify how close a mutant machine is to the specification machine by giving a score (likely hood) that a mutant machine is a 
            specification machine. </p>
            <p>The CNN is trained on a image representation of the finite state machine (FSM) as can be seen in fig 1.1-3.
            The dataset that the model is trained on is created by producing both specification and mutation machines from a given specification FSM. 
            A specification machine is made by swamping two rows changing the image but is still a correct representation of the specification machine. 
            But to create the mutation machine one pixel is chosen to be randomly changed out with a different colour. 
            The replacement is a colour from the set of colours that are from the same category as the original mutant pixal. 
            For example, if a state was changed it will be changed with another colour which represents a states. 
            Or if a input in mutated it will be changed with another colour from the inputs colour set. Etc.

        <p>Using the order created by the CNN scores, the killer sequences are created for each mutation machine. 
            This sequences is then tested against the rest of the mutation machines to and checks to see how many of them are killed with this sequence. 
            This is repeated until all mutation machines are killed, resulting in a set of sequences that will kill all mutants. 
            By using the CNN it will accelerate this process as it provides the order to process the mutants in a way that the mutants at the begining will kill more mutants. 
            This will help to reduce the progessing time as less mutants machines will need to be processed.
